      " axa s.a. (styled as axa) is a french multinational insurance firm. the head office is in the 8th arrondissement of paris. it also provides investment management and other financial services. the axa group operates primarily in western europe, north america, the india pacific region, and the middle east, with a presence also in africa. axa is a conglomerate of independently-run businesses, operated according to the laws and regulations of many different countries. it is a component of the euro stoxx 50 stock market index. the company was founded in 1816 as mutuelle de l'assurance contre l'incendie (the ancienne mutuelle). it acquired compagnie parisienne de garantie in 1978 and became mutuelles unies. in 1982, it merged with the drouot group, owned by the hottinguer family, becoming mutuelles unies/drouot. the firm adopted the axa name in 1985. axa took over the equitable in 1991 and bought union des assurances de paris (uap), france's largest insurer, in 1996 to become axa-uap. it reverted to the name axa in 1999. in february 1999, axa acquired guardian royal exchange. in may 2000, it acquired all shares it did not already own in sun life & provincial holdings. on june 14,

(us$688.51 million). despite being written by the company in upper case, \"axa\" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. after acquiring the drouot group in 1982, chairman and ceo claude bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. initially, \"elan\" was the top choice, but canadian executives balked because \"elan\" is the french word for a moose or elk. in 1985, bébéar chose the name axa. axa trades in the united kingdom as axa uk, with subsidiaries including axa insurance, axa wealth and axa health. axa ppp healthcare was created when axa bought guardian royal exchange (gre), though it subsequently sold the other parts of gre to aegon. the company also owns the online insurer

officially known as 'the axa training centre.' axa sun life was created following the merger between axa equity & law and sun life assurance society. in 2006 winterthur life in the uk was absorbed although axa continues to use the winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. the business units are: axa sold axa sun life holdings to resolution limited in autumn 2010, whilst
